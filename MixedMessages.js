//As a musician who understands basic music theory (note locations, first/fifth two note chords, progressions, musical keys)
//I want the song-generator to create multiple random batches of three or four syllable per line lyrics and a set chord progression in a random key
//So that I can immediately play a prefabricated song

//Given the song-generator is run
//When the song-generator is set to four batches and the three syllable per line lyric option
//Then a random string of lyrics a total of twelve syllables long (four batches of three syllables), a chord progression, and a random musical key are generated, ex: [["It's alright", "to tell me", "what you think", "about me"], "I–V–vi–IV", "C major"]
