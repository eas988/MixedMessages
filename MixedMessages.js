//As a musician who understands basic music theory (note locations, first/fifth two note chords, progressions, musical keys)
//I want the song-generator to create multiple random batches of twelve or sixteen syllables divided into four segments lyrics and a randomized variant of the I–V–vi–IV chord progression in a random key
//So that I can immediately play a prefabricated song

//Given the song-generator is set to four batches and the twelve syllables lyric option
//When the song-generator is run
//Then a random string of lyrics a total of twelve syllables long (four lines of three syllables), a randomized variant of the I-V-vi-IV chord progression, and a random musical key are generated, ex: [["It's alright", "to tell me", "what you think", "about me"], "I–V–vi–IV", "C major"]

//Given the song-generator has produced at least four lines of lyrics, regardless of syllable count
//When comparing the last word of the second and fourth lines
//Then the words must rhyme

//Issue: Import and Require are mutually exclusive? Syllables package is import, cannot figure out how to get words.txt without require. Rhymes is also require. 
//Possible solution - find syllable tracker that is not an import? --- https://www.npmjs.com/package/syllables
